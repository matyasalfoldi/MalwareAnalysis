\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item What operating system and type of device is on 10.11.11.94?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Based on TTL=64, Don't fragment flag set, Maximum segment size of 1460, and a Window size which isn't any common, so one can safely assume that it is variable, the OS is Linux. Based on the MAC address it is related to Foxconn, so it is either a gaming console or a mobile device.
  \item Based on HTTP requests it uses Chrome OS, so it is most likely a Chromebook. (Although User-Agents can usually be easily modified, but assuming that this is a company setting it isn't that likely that someone would modify it.)
  \end{itemize}
\item What operating system and type of device is on 10.11.11.121?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Based on the same values as for .94 this is also has Linux on it.
  \item Looking at http requests Android 9, and it is a SAMSUNG SM-N950U
  \end{itemize}
\item Based on the MAC address for 10.11.11.145, who is the manufacturer or vendor?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Motorola
  \end{itemize}
\item What operating system and type of device is on 10.11.11.179?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item OS X (looking into the http requests confirms this). It is probably a Macbook
  \end{itemize}
\item What version of Windows is being used on the host at 10.11.11.195?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It seems like Windows 10, based on http requests
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the user account name used to log into the Windows host at 10.11.11.200?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item brandon.gilbert based on the CNameString in kerberos communication.
  \end{itemize}
\item What operating system and type of device is on 10.11.11.217?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It looks like a Linux device based on IP/TCP headers, but the manufacturer is apple
  \item http requests show that it is an iPad
  \end{itemize}
\item What IP is the Windows host that downloaded a Windows executable file over HTTP?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 10.11.11.203 (40group.tiff)
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the URL that returned the Windows executable file?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item acjabogados.com/40group.tiff
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the SHA256 file hash for that Windows executable file?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 8d5d36c8ffb0a9c81b145aa40c1ff3475702fb0b5f9e08e0577bdc405087e635
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the detection rate for that SHA256 hash on VirusTotal?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 58/72
  \end{itemize}
\item What public IP addresses did that Windows host attempt to connect over TCP after the executable file was downloaded?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 138.201.6.195 which is reported to have been a C2 server for various malware, but mostly IcedId
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the host name and Windows user account name used on that IP address?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item host: TUCKER-WIN7-PC
  \item user: candice.tucker
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
