\subsection{Network devices on the subnet}
The subnet is 10.6.12.0/24\newline
\begin{itemize}
\item 10.6.12.12
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Seems to be a Windows machine based on IP/TCP header
  \end{itemize}
\item 10.6.12.157
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Windows machine. Based on the User Agent win 10
  \item Hostname: DESKTOP-86J4BX
  \item User: ted.brokowski
  \end{itemize}
\item 10.6.12.203
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Also a windows machine. Based on the User Agent also a win 10
  \item Hostname: LAPTOP-5WKHX9YG
  \item User: frank.brokowski
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Possibly Malicous Files Downloaded}
\subsubsection{invoice-86495.doc}
This one isn't detected, further checking will be needed to determine if it is really harmless.
\subsubsection{june11.dll}
https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d36366666b407fe5527b96696377ee7b\newline
a9b609c8ef4561fa76af218ddd764dec\newline
It has a relatively high detection rate, so it is most certainly malicious, although the exact type can't be said for sure based on what the AV vendors detect, but possibly a Zbot.
\subsection{Suspicious connections}
There are quite a few Http requests to 5.101.51.151 (snnmnkxdhflwgthqismb.com), which is reported to be malicious(C2).\newline
Its post.php seems to be used for communication.\newline
Also there is the connection between 10.6.12.203 and 205.185.125.104.\newline
The first is a get to /pQBtWj and afterwards we can see the downloading of the june11.dll.\newline
\subsection{How did the infection take place}
What I can say for sure, is that 10.6.12.157 opened the .doc file, and afterwards 10.6.12.203 connected to the malicious ip, where it downloaded the dll, will have to see if these events have anything related.\newline
A strong indication that 10.6.12.157 was infected first is what seems like suspicious SMB communication.\newline
Right after the negotiation and session setup, it tries to access the DC-s IPC share.\newline
Although this all happened even before the .doc file was downloaded.\newline
