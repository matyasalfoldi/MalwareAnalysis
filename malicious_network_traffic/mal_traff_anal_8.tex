	Basic info about the infected host
	\begin{itemize}
 		\item Ip: 10.0.0.179
		\item Name: DESKTOP-M1JC4XX (From kerberos comm.)
		\item User: ronaldo.paccione      (From kerberos comm.)
	\end{itemize}
	Malware info:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Source: 198.12.66.108
		\item Executable name: jojo.exe
		\item md5: AD6564701054B692BCF47B5FEB6324A2

	\end{itemize}
	Starting process of the malware infection:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Based on knowing that WinHttpRequest was called and the single HTTP Get can be seen in the packet, it all started from a macro, probably from a word document.
	\end{itemize}
	Possible C2s:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 37.120.174.218 (Lets Encrypt Free SSL Cert used)
	\end{itemize}
	Further indication of compromise:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item api.ipify.org usage
		\item SMTP communication with 185.61.152.63
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The infected host logs in with the user am9qb0BiaWczLmljdQ== (base64-d jojo@big3.icu)
			\item it sends an email to itself, since RCPT TO is jojo@big3.icu too
			\item The subject has the user and the host name, and various data is exfiltrated, including usernames/passwords.
			\item Later on also a large encrypted block gets sent. (Further analysis of the malware needed for more info)
			\item The alrert also signals that this is related to AgentTesla
